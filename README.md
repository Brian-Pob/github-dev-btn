# github-dev-btn

Chrome extension to add a button to open a GitHub repo in the VS Code web editor (aka github.dev).

## Description

This extension adds a button to GitHub repositories to open the repo in the VS Code web editor. I created this extension to experiment with Chrome extensions and to practice using Javascript.

The code is written in Javascript. It is pretty hacky as I am just starting out.

Pull requests and comments are welcome.
